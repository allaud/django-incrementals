The most effective Django realization of incremental fields. My synthetic tests gives up to x30-x60 optimization.
It uses redis cache so you need to install Redis and Pyhton redis driver.

Best suitable for fields:
- Comments count
- Record rating
- Number of views
- Statistic counters
- Other counters

Usage example:

#models.py
from incrementals.decorators import IncrementalManager

class ExampleModel(models.Model):
    field = models.IntegerField(primary_key=True)

    #this is for incrementals:
    objects = IncrementalManager()
    incremental = ['downloads', 'rating']

#settings.py
REDIS = redis.Redis('localhost')    #or redis object
INCREMENTALS_FLUCTUATION = 7        #db-commit period
